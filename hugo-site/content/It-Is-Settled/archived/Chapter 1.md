# Chapter 1

## Reality Begins With God

Reality does not begin with human questions. It begins with God making Himself known. Scripture exists because God is not silent. He reveals who He is, how He relates to humanity, and what He has done. The story of the gospel is not the story of people discovering God, but of God disclosing reality before it was understood.

This matters because revelation establishes objectivity. Truth is not constructed from experience, refined through reflection, or reached through effort. It is revealed. God speaks before we respond. He acts before we interpret. Sin explains why revelation is necessary, but it does not initiate the story. God does.

When this order is reversed, confusion follows. When revelation is replaced with interpretation, everything loses its weight. Grace can sound like opinion. Truth can sound like perspective. Assurance can sound like confidence. Scripture can sound like advice.

None of those things are false—but none of them are stable.

Romans refuses to build on instability. It does not begin by asking how people should live. It begins by declaring what is true about God, about humanity, and about the situation between them. Only after reality is disclosed does life begin to make sense.

This is why Scripture consistently moves from revelation to response. God reveals Himself, then calls for understanding. God acts, then explains the meaning of that action. God speaks, then invites trust. The order is never reversed. Life is not the starting point; it is the outcome.

When God is not clearly recognized as the one who defines reality, people instinctively look elsewhere for grounding. Experience begins to interpret truth. Feelings begin to weigh more than declaration. Sincerity begins to substitute for certainty. The result is not rebellion, but instability.

This instability explains why many sincere people feel unsettled even while believing the right things. They may affirm grace, but experience still feels authoritative. They may agree with truth, but perspective still feels negotiable. They may believe Scripture, but hear it as guidance rather than disclosure.

The issue was never grace — it was authority.

More precisely, it was the question of who has the right to define what is true.

Scripture’s answer is unambiguous. God defines reality because God reveals Himself. The gospel does not begin with human need, human effort, or human failure. It begins with God acting, God speaking, and God making Himself known.

Only when this is settled can anything else be understood rightly.

This chapter does not explain the human problem yet. It establishes the reference point. Before Scripture diagnoses sin, it reveals God. Before it addresses collapse, it establishes truth. Before it speaks about how to live, it declares what is real.

Everything that follows depends on this.

**It is settled from God’s perspective.** Reality does not wait for our agreement to become true.
