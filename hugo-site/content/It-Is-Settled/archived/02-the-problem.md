# Chapter 2  
## The Problem Romans Exposes

Before Romans ever offers assurance, it insists on clarity.

Paul does not begin with comfort.  
He begins with truth — and the truth is not flattering.

Romans does not attempt to convince the reader that they need improvement.  
It insists that something far deeper is wrong (Romans 1:18).

## A Universal Condition

One of the most important things to notice in Romans is *how* Paul speaks about sin.

He does not treat sin merely as behavior.  
He treats it as a **condition** that affects every person equally.

Romans unfolds a sweeping diagnosis:

- Gentiles are accountable (Romans 1:18–32)
- Jews are accountable (Romans 2:1–24)
- The religious are accountable (Romans 2:17–29)
- The moral are accountable (Romans 2:1–3)

No group is given an advantage when it comes to standing righteous before God (Romans 3:9).

This is not an argument against morality or religion —  
it is an argument against **using them as a foundation**.

## The Failure of Self-Assessment

Human instinct leans toward comparison.

We measure ourselves:
- against others
- against visible failures
- against our own intentions

Romans removes the comfort of comparison by changing the standard.

The question is no longer:
> “Am I better than someone else?”

The question becomes:
> “Can I stand righteous before God?”

Once that question is asked honestly, comparison collapses (Romans 3:10–12).

## Law Clarifies — It Does Not Cure

One of Paul’s most misunderstood points in Romans is the role of law.

Law was never given to fix the problem it reveals.

Instead:
- Law **defines** righteousness
- Law **exposes** failure
- Law **removes excuses**

Paul states this plainly: through law comes the knowledge of sin (Romans 3:20).

This is why Romans insists that no one will be justified *by* law —  
not because law is bad, but because the problem is deeper than instruction (Romans 3:19).

Telling a broken system how it should function does not repair it.

---

## The Weight of the Diagnosis

Romans presses the reader into an uncomfortable realization:

Even sincere effort cannot undo what already is.

This is why Romans does not move quickly to solution.  
It wants the reader to feel the full weight of the problem (Romans 3:19).

Because if the problem is misunderstood, the solution will be reduced.

And if the solution is reduced, assurance will never be settled.

---

## Why This Matters

Many believers struggle not because they doubt God’s power,  
but because they quietly assume that **something is still required of them**  
before God’s verdict can be secure.

Romans dismantles that assumption at the root.

Until the problem is seen clearly:
- grace feels risky
- assurance feels irresponsible
- rest feels premature

But once the problem is understood, a surprising thing happens:

**The solution no longer feels excessive — it feels necessary.**

In the next chapter, Romans introduces the turning point —  
not human resolve, but **God’s action** (Romans 3:21).

That is where everything changes.
