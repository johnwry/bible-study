# Chapter 4  
## It Is Settled

At this point in Romans, a question naturally arises:

If justification is truly God’s verdict,  
can it ever be undone?

Paul does not avoid that question.  
He answers it by strengthening the claim.

Romans does not move toward uncertainty —  
it moves toward **assurance** (Romans 5:1–2).

## Peace Is the Result, Not the Goal

Romans presents peace with God as something that follows justification, not something pursued afterward.

Paul states it simply:  
having been justified by faith, we have peace with God (Romans 5:1).

Peace is not achieved through spiritual effort.  
It is received as a consequence of what God has already declared.

When peace is treated as a goal, it becomes fragile.  
When peace is received as a result, it becomes stable.

## The Logic of Permanence

Paul’s argument in Romans is not emotional.  
It is logical.

If justification depends on God’s righteousness,  
then its permanence depends on God’s integrity.

Paul grounds assurance not in the believer’s consistency,  
but in God’s demonstrated action in Christ (Romans 5:6–8).

To suggest that justification can be reversed is to suggest that God’s verdict was premature or incomplete.

Romans allows neither option.

God does not issue provisional declarations.

## Where Assurance Actually Comes From

Assurance is often treated as a feeling.  
Romans treats it as a conclusion.

It does not arise from introspection,  
but from understanding what God has done.

This is why Paul repeatedly points the reader outward —  
to Christ’s work, not the believer’s performance (Romans 5:9–10).

The clearer the verdict, the stronger the assurance.

## Why Doubt Persists

Even with clear teaching, many believers still struggle with doubt.

Romans exposes why:

- Doubt survives when justification is quietly re-defined  
- Fear remains when peace is treated as conditional  
- Anxiety grows when the focus returns to self  

Paul warns that shifting foundations always weaken confidence (Romans 4:20–21).

Assurance falters whenever trust moves away from God’s promise and back onto human stability.

## Settled Means Settled

The phrase “it is settled” is not meant to be poetic.

It is meant to be precise.

What God has declared righteous, He does not later place under review (Romans 8:33).  
What God has reconciled, He does not later distance (Romans 5:10).  
What God has justified, He does not later threaten (Romans 8:1).

This is not optimism.  
It is consistency.

## Living Under a Final Verdict

When the verdict is understood as final, something changes.

The believer no longer lives under evaluation,  
but under acceptance (Romans 5:2).

This does not lead to indifference.  
It leads to freedom.

And freedom, Romans will show, produces a very different kind of life.

In the final chapter, we turn to the practical question:

If the matter is settled —  
**how should that reality shape the way we live?**
