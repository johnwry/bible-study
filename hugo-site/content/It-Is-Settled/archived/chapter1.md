### Purpose of This Book

This book was written to help readers understand a simple but often misunderstood truth:

**What God has settled, does not need to be re-settled by us.**

Many believers live as though their standing before God is fragile, uncertain, or dependent on their ongoing performance. The message of Romans presents a very different picture — one where God acts decisively, justly, and finally.

This book does not attempt to be technical or academic.  
It is written in clear language, with careful thought, so that the reader can follow the flow of Paul’s argument without needing a background in theology.

Romans will be treated as a **message to be understood**, not merely verses to be quoted.

### How to Use This Book

- Read slowly  
- Follow the argument as it unfolds  
- Let conclusions arise from the text itself  
- Resist the urge to insert assumptions  

The goal is not to tell you *what to think*, but to help you see **what the text is actually saying**.
