## Chapter 6 — Struggle Explained (Refined Book Prose)

Once standing is established, another question appears — one many people feel but rarely say out loud.

If the relationship with God is settled,
 why does struggle remain?

Why do old habits still pull?
 Why does desire conflict with intention?
 Why does clarity not always produce consistency?

Scripture does not describe moments of tension as proof that nothing changed.
 But it also does not describe ongoing defeat as the natural state of a believer.
 The tension exists while reality is being understood.
 Defeat continues only when reality is not counted on.

Struggle does not mean the resolution was incomplete.
 It means life is now being lived in a new reality that is still being understood.

A new standing does not automatically erase old patterns of thinking.
 It changes position immediately,
 but experience often takes time to align with that position.

This is where the idea of “counting on what is real” becomes important.

A person can have a new standing and still live as if nothing changed.
 Not because the standing is weak,
 but because attention is still fixed on the old ground.

You are always leaning on something.
 Either the old patterns continue to define daily life,
 or the new standing begins to shape it.

This is why Scripture speaks of presenting yourself.
 It is not about earning position.
 Position is already established.
 It is about which reality you allow to guide your choices.

A person can stand secure before God and still live miserably if attention never leaves the old mindset. That misery does not come from lack of standing. It comes from living as if the old master still holds authority.

The new standing provides everything needed for fullness of life.
 But fullness is not found by managing sin all day.
 It is found by resting in Christ and allowing that rest to shape daily living.

The shift is not forced.
 It is recognized.

Life changes when what is already true
 is finally treated as true.
