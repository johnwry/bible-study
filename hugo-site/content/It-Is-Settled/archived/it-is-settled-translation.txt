It's solved!
From God's perspective
A clear and simple journey through the message of Romans

Author: John Wry

Purpose of this book
This book was written to help the reader understand a simple, but often
misunderstood:
What God has resolved does not need to be resolved again by us.
Many believers live as if their standing before God is fragile, uncertain, or dependent on their
ongoing performance. The message of Romans presents a very different picture: one in which God acts
decisively, justly, and ultimately.
This book does not attempt to be technical or academic.

It is written in clear and reflective language, so that the reader can follow Paul's argument without needing
prior theological training.
Romans will be treated as a message to be understood, not just as verses to be quoted.

How to use this book

Follow the plot as it unfolds
Allow the conclusions to emerge from the text.
Resist the temptation to insert assumptions

PRELUDE
Reality doesn't begin with us
Most people live as if reality begins where their thoughts begin.

Or where their emotions begin.
Or where their questions begin.
And that feels natural… until we notice how fragile it is.
Because if reality begins with me, then reality changes when I change.
It changes with my mood. It changes with my mental clarity. It changes with my energy.
It changes with my last fall or my last "good day".
But the Bible does not allow that starting point.
The Bible begins with a silent but absolute statement: God is.
Not as a conclusion we reach, but as a reality that precedes us. Before human beings interpret anything, God
already exists, already acts, already speaks.
Here's a question worth asking slowly:
Am I willing to accept that reality is true before I understand it?

Because that is what revelation implies.
Scripture exists because God is not silent.
Not because humanity deserves it, nor because humanity has successfully sought it, but because God
decided to make himself known.

And when God reveals himself, one thing is established:
Truth is not constructed from human experience; it is declared from divine authority.
God speaks before we respond.
That's not just a pious idea. It's the foundation of objectivity.
If we reverse that order, everything that follows becomes unstable. Even beautiful words like “grace,” “faith,”
and “security” become slippery. Grace begins to sound like opinion. Faith begins to sound like effort. Security
begins to sound like presumption.

Machine Translated by Google

And then, without realizing it, we end up living not under revelation… but under interpretation.

Isn't that the root of much of our spiritual anxiety?
It's not that we don't know what the Bible says... but we don't know what authority it has over what we feel.

God is not a piece within the world
It is the world's point of reference.
Saying “God is the center” might sound like a tired religious phrase. But in Romans—
And throughout the Bible—that phrase has a concrete meaning: God is not an accessory to improve life.
God is the one who defines what is real, true, and good.
This means that God does not enter my story to collaborate with my plans.
My story exists within His reality.
What if God is not one perspective among others, but the criterion of all perspectives?

Therefore, my experience cannot sit as judge over His word. My conscience cannot have the final say. My
performance cannot define my position.
That doesn't eliminate the experience. It puts it in context.

It doesn't eliminate feelings. It interprets them.
It does not eliminate consciousness. It subjects it to a higher reference point.

How human life really works
Every life has a center.

Even those who say "I don't believe in anything" live from something they consider more reliable than God:
their reason, their experience, their freedom, their intuition, their identity, their community, their morality,
their tradition.
The center doesn't always confess, but it always operates.

And from that center flows an order:
Beliefs: what we assume to be true

Machine Translated by Google

Values: what we celebrate and defend
Behavior: what we naturally do
That's why behavior is always the last link.
It is not the beginning of the problem; it is its visible symptom.

This explains why starting with "behaving better" is so insufficient.
How can behavior heal what the behavior itself is only exhibiting?

If the heart is disoriented, behavior becomes merely a facade.

The collapse of man is not only moral.
It's a reference point.

And here we arrive at an essential observation: when God is displaced as the point of reference, life does
not remain neutral. It does not remain "the same but without religion." It is reoriented.
It first becomes noticeable in behavior.
Then it becomes consolidated in the values.

And finally, it is justified in thought.
That is to say:

They are doing what shouldn't be done.

then what “is appropriate” is redefined.
and then an explanation is constructed to defend it.
Isn't that how the human heart works?
First choose, then evaluate, and then reason.
When this is understood, it is also understood why recovery cannot begin with effort.

Because effort doesn't change the starting point.

Why restoration begins with revelation

Machine Translated by Google

and not with reform.
If the problem were only behavior, God would give us instructions.
If it were just about values, it would give us persuasion.

If it were just a thought, it would give us information.
But God does something more radical: He reveals Himself.

Because the root of the problem is not just what we do.
That's what we treat as real.
What, then, is the gospel?
It's not a new set of rules. It's not better motivation. It's not extra help so that we can finally "make it."

It is God acting from outside the human system to restore what human beings cannot restore from
within.
With that clear, Romans can begin.

MOVEMENT 1
Reality begins with God
(Romans 1:1–17)
If one reads Romans hastily, one might think that Paul is giving a formal introduction. But if one reads
carefully, something different becomes apparent: Paul is not opening a letter;
is establishing a universe.
And the first thing he does is refuse to start where we usually start.
We usually start with ourselves:
how we feel, what we lack, what we fear, what we fail at, what we want to fix.
Paul begins with God.
Because?
Because the gospel isn't primarily an answer to my crisis. It's a declaration of God's reality.

Paul presents himself as an envoy
not as originator.
Paul does not begin by saying, “I think.”
It begins by saying, essentially: “I belong.”
He defines himself as a servant, as set apart, as called. In other words: his life is situated within a prior
authority.
This is already a correction for the reader.
Because if the messenger is not the source, neither can the reader become the judge of the message.
The message is not tied to Paul's personality. It does not depend on his charisma.

It doesn't depend on your history. It depends on God.
Isn't that one of our most frequent temptations?
Treating the truth as something we validate based on who says it, or based on how we feel about it.

Machine Translated by Google

Romans cuts off that possibility from the start: this is not a message about God; it is a message
from God.

The Son is at the heart of the message.

not a method.
Then Paul does something even more important: he puts the Son at the center. Not as a devotional
idea, but as the point where reality becomes public.
The gospel is not about “how to get to God”.
It is “God has come to act and to reveal.”
This completely changes the tone of Christianity.
Because many live as if the gospel were a path we travel to reach security. But Paul presents the
gospel as an intervention that has already taken place.
If God has already spoken through His Son, then… what is left to negotiate?
What remains to be completed?

What remains to be proven?
Here the reader begins to feel it: Christianity does not rest on our capacity to
hold it.

Paul writes to believers
because clarity is lost.
This is key for your book.
Paul writes to people who already believe. Then the question arises naturally:
Why explain the gospel again to those who already know it?
Because knowing facts is not the same as living from an established reality.
A believer can affirm correct doctrines and still live insecurely. They can say “I am saved” and still
interpret every fall as a threat. They can speak of grace and still organize their life as if God were
always evaluating them.

Machine Translated by Google

So Paul isn't writing to add to religion. He's writing to restore the foundation, so that believers don't live based on
self-evaluation, but on what God has declared.

The gospel is power
not only true.
And then comes the phrase: the gospel is the power of God for salvation.
Many repeat it as if it meant “the gospel has the power to inspire me.” But Paul is saying something more
objective:
The gospel does something.
It doesn't just teach. It doesn't just inform. It doesn't just motivate.

What kind of gospel would we need if the problem were simply ignorance?
An explanation would suffice.
But if the problem is that reality has been displaced, then power is needed: power to restore, power to establish,
power to move us to a new condition.
Here your central theme emerges naturally:
If the gospel is the power of God, then salvation does not ultimately rest on what man maintains, but on what
God accomplishes.

The gospel reveals the justice of God
And that changes the world.
Paul does not say, “Here is how to be righteous.”
It says: “Here the justice of God is revealed.”
This means that justice is not primarily about our behavior, but about what God declares to be true and right in
His eyes.
And this revelation is what creates rest.
Because if justice depended on me producing it, I would always live in tension: Did I do enough? Was I
consistent? Did I stray too far? Did I lose ground?

Machine Translated by Google

But if justice is revealed as an action of God—if it comes from Him—then there is a foundation that does not
change with my fluctuations.
Isn't this what so many believers long for without knowing how to name it?
Not a push to try harder, but a reality so firm that life can be sustained on it.

Romans begins with God
so that sin is not the center.
Paul has not yet diagnosed sin, and that is intentional. Because if the reader begins with sin, the
reader begins interpreting everything from the perspective of man.
But if the reader begins with God, sin will be seen in its proper place: real, devastating, but not ultimate. Serious,
but not sovereign.
Reality begins with God.

And once that is clear, Romans can accurately describe what happens when God is displaced.

That will be the next move.

MOVEMENT 2
God displaced
(Romans 1:18–32)
After clearly establishing who God is and what the gospel is, Paul does something inevitable but carefully
controlled: he describes what happens when that reality is displaced.

He doesn't do it in a hurry.

He doesn't do it in a moralistic tone.
And he doesn't do it to shock the reader with a list of sins.
He does this to explain why the world is the way it is.
And, even more importantly, to explain why human beings cannot correct themselves simply by
trying to live better.

The problem is not the absence of God
but displacement of God.
Paul does not say that God is unknown. He says that God has been made known.
This distinction is crucial.
The human problem does not begin with ignorance, but with rejection. Not with a lack of information,
but with a prior decision: God will no longer be the point of reference.
This changes everything.

Because when God ceases to be the ultimate reference point, something else takes His place.
Not necessarily something overtly evil. Often something close, understandable, manageable.

The experience.
The desire.

Autonomy.
Personal preference.

Machine Translated by Google

Something that feels more immediate than a revealed truth.
Isn't this shift much more common—and much more subtle—than we usually admit?

Not to deny God, but to reposition Him. Not to expel Him, but to consult Him only when it is convenient.
Pablo describes this movement with one repeated word: exchange.
It's not about emptiness. It's about replacement.

When God stops defining reality
Reality doesn't disappear, it is reinterpreted.
Here Paul introduces a profound dynamic: when God is displaced, the truth is not eliminated. It is relocated.

What was once received as revelation is now filtered through experience.
What was once accepted as true is now evaluated according to its usefulness.
What used to carry weight is now negotiated.
The question of truth is no longer: “Is it real?”
The question is: "Will it work for me?"

What kind of life is built when utility replaces truth?
A practical, perhaps sincere life… but profoundly unstable.
This is the beginning of the collapse.

The first breakdown: behavior
Paul first describes what is most visible: human behavior.
But it is important to note something: he does not present the behavior as the cause, but as the result.

Behavior becomes disordered because it no longer flows from a reality established by God.
It begins to respond to impulses disconnected from the truth. Not because humankind has stopped knowing
what is right, but because what is right no longer has authority.
Here's an awkward question:

Machine Translated by Google

How often do we treat behavior as the main problem, when it is only the most obvious symptom?

When behavior becomes the focus of diagnosis, a behavioral solution will inevitably be sought: rules,
pressure, surveillance, comparison.
But Paul doesn't do that.
Describe the behavior to show that something deeper has already shifted.

The second collapse: the values
As behavior becomes disordered, something inevitable happens: values must be adjusted to sustain it.

What once caused shame is now beginning to be justified.
What used to be uncomfortable is beginning to become normal.
What was once resisted is now beginning to be celebrated.

This is not an accidental process. It is a moral reorganization.
Values don't change because human beings have reflected better, but because
It needs internal consistency. Nobody lives comfortably contradicting themselves.
He's consistent in what he does.

Then values align with behavior.
Doesn't this explain why many moral discussions seem impossible?
It's not just about ethical disagreements. It's about different points of reference.
When God no longer defines what is good, something else must do it.

The deepest collapse: the way of thinking
Pablo saves the most serious thing for last: the collapse of thought.
This point is key to understanding Romans—and to understanding ourselves.
The problem is not that human beings have stopped reasoning.
The problem is that reason no longer points towards the truth.

Machine Translated by Google

Thought does not become irrational; it becomes functional. It serves what has already been chosen.
Defend what is already valued. Justify what is already practiced.
Here the question changes:
It's no longer "what is true?"
But rather, "how can I stand by what I've already decided?"
Don't we recognize this dynamic even in ourselves?
How do we find arguments after we've made a decision?
How do we reinterpret reality to protect what we wish to preserve?
Paul describes a mind that has not lost capacity, but direction.
When God is displaced, thought does not remain neutral. It becomes captive.

Why this diagnosis is devastating
and necessary.

This triple collapse—behavior, values, thought—has one unavoidable implication: recovery from within is
impossible.
If behavior is disordered, discipline alone is not enough.
If values are reversed, exhortation alone is not enough.
If thinking is misguided, education alone is not enough.
The problem is not superficial. It is structural.
And here Paul closes the door to all false hope of self-salvation.
What recourse remains when even thought can no longer be trusted as a judge of truth?

Only one: revelation from outside the system.
That's why Romans doesn't go straight to instructions. It goes to intervention.

Paul does not describe this to shame.
but to legitimize what God will do.

Machine Translated by Google

It is important to note Pablo's tone.
It's not meant as contempt.

It's not about moral superiority.
It's clear.
Paul does not describe human collapse to humiliate the reader, but to make one thing
absolutely clear: no one can fix this from within.
If this reality is not accepted, grace will always seem excessive.
Security will seem dangerous.
The justification will seem irresponsible.
But when the diagnosis is understood, the solution stops seeming extreme… and starts to seem
necessary.

The transition point
So far, Romanos has done two things:
1. He has established God as the point of reference for reality.
2. It has shown what happens when that reference point is displaced.
He has not yet presented the solution.
And that is also deliberate.
Because if the reader does not see the problem clearly, he will inevitably reduce God's answer
to something manageable, partial, or cooperative.
Romans will not allow that.
In the next move, Pablo introduces the decisive turning point:
Not what human beings should do, but
what God does when human beings cannot.
That is the heart of the gospel.

MOVEMENT 3
No human advantage
(Romans 2:1–3:20)
After describing the collapse that occurs when God is displaced, Paul does something that may be
uncomfortable for many readers: he does not allow anyone to be placed outside the diagnosis.

So far, it might seem easy to agree.
It's easy to say, "Yes, that's the way the world is."

It's easy to think about others.

Pablo does not allow it.
Carefully, but firmly, he now turns his attention to those who might feel safe from the above description.
Not because they are worse, but because the illusion of advantage is one of the most persistent forms
of human self-deception.

The trial is not avoided by acknowledging the problem.
Paul begins by dismantling a silent assumption: that recognizing evil in others is equivalent to being
safe from it.
Judging other people's messiness can give a momentary sense of moral clarity. It creates distance. It brings
relief. It gives the impression of being on the right side of the line.
But Paul introduces a question that disarms that comfort:
What criteria do you use to judge?
Because the very act of judging reveals something unsettling: the one who judges recognizes the
standard, but is not thereby exempt from it.
Here, Paul is not denouncing the trial as an act. He is exposing the false security that relies on it.

Isn't this one of our favorite shelters?
Not to deny the truth, but to use it to position ourselves better than others.

Machine Translated by Google

Morality does not confer an advantage

Then, Paul implicitly addresses those who live with a certain visible righteousness. Responsible people.
Disciplined people. People who value what is good.
And here something important happens: Paul does not deny the social value of morality. He does not
ridicule it. He does not despise it.

Simply place it in its correct position.
Morality can order external life.
It can benefit others.
It can produce social stability.
But it cannot produce justice before God.
Because the problem is not just what is done, but who defines the measure.
What happens when morality becomes the basis of security?
It transforms into a comparison.
And the comparison always needs someone worse.
Pablo does not allow that land.

Religion doesn't solve the problem either.
Next, Paul turns his attention to those who possess something more than morality: revelation.
Here the argument becomes more delicate.
Having received the law, knowing God's will, having access to His word, might seem like a
decisive advantage.
But Paul introduces a crucial distinction:
Knowing the truth does not equate to being aligned with it.
The law reveals what is right, but it doesn't produce the capacity to live by it. It illuminates the
standard, but it doesn't transform the heart.
This raises a difficult question:
What happens when revelation becomes identity, instead of becoming dependence?

Machine Translated by Google

Religion, when used as a credential, does not protect from judgment. It can even intensify accountability.

Not because the law is bad, but because clarity does not replace justice.

The underlying problem: listening without responding
At this point, Paul is not attacking irreligious people, nor religious people, nor moral people.

It is dismantling a common idea: that closeness to the truth equals security.

But the truth does not protect through proximity.
It only protects when God acts.
Paul insists: it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God's sight, but those who obey it.
And here the attentive reader must pause.
Because this statement is not designed to reassure.
It is designed to close off an exit.
Who can truly claim to have fulfilled their obligations?
Who can stand there without comparing, relativizing, or redefining again?
Pablo has not responded yet.
Just let the weight of the question remain.

When all comparisons fall apart
As the argument progresses, one thing becomes clear: every possible advantage has been neutralized.

Immorality does not protect.
Morality does not protect.
Religion does not protect.
Knowledge does not protect.

Machine Translated by Google

Everything we normally use to differentiate ourselves has been put on the same level.
And then Paul does something definitive: he unites everyone under a single condition.
Not as rhetorical exaggeration.
Not as religious pessimism.
But as a logical conclusion.
Everyone is under sin.
This isn't just about individual acts. It's about a common condition that affects everyone.
all of humanity.

What remains when there is no one left to compare oneself to?
Only reality remains.

The purpose of the law is clear
At this point, Paul finally clarifies the role of the law with a precision that many overlook.

The law was not given to justify.
It was given to make visible.
To define the standard.
To show the distance.
To shut my mouth.
This image is powerful: all mouths closed.
Not because there is nothing left to say, but because there is no longer any possible defense.

The law is not a stepping stone to climb.
It is a mirror that reveals.
Doesn't this explain why the law, when used as a tool for spiritual improvement, produces
frustration instead of life?
It wasn't designed to heal.
It was designed to show the need for something more.

Machine Translated by Google

The moment of silence
Romanos arrives here at a deliberate point of stillness.
There is no solution yet.
There is no relief yet.
There are no instructions.
Only one clearly established reality:
Nobody has an advantage.

No one can justify themselves.

No one can appeal to themselves.
This silence is necessary.

Because as long as there is a possibility of contributing something, grace will be perceived as a
complement.
As long as there is a secret advantage, salvation will be negotiable.
As long as someone retains a basis for self-reliance, the gospel will be diminished.
Pablo will not allow that.

Preparing the ground for God's action
This whole movement has a clear purpose: to prepare the ground for an action that cannot be shared.

If human beings could contribute, God would assist.
But if humans cannot, God must act.
And that is exactly what Pablo will present next.
Not an improvement of the human system,
not a collaboration between effort and grace, but a
decisive intervention.

In the next move, Romans introduces the turning point:
God acts where no one else can.
And when God acts, reality changes.

Machine Translated by Google

MOVEMENT 4
God acts
(Romans 3:21–31)
After a silence that leaves everyone speechless, Paul introduces two words that change everything:

But now.
They are not a literary transition.
They are a statement of reality.
So far, everything has been diagnostic.
Clear, honest, and irrefutable.
Human beings cannot justify themselves.
The law cannot produce justice.
No advantage remains.
And just when there is nothing left to hold on to, Paul does not say, “Therefore, strive harder.”

He says: God acts.

Justice appears from outside the human system.
Paul is careful with his words.
It does not say that justice was discovered.
It doesn't say that it was developed.
It does not say that she was hit.
He says he has manifested himself.
This means that justice does not arise from within the human being. It is not born from deep
repentance, nor from sincere commitment, nor from progressive obedience.
It comes from God and enters the scene as something already existing, now revealed.
It's worth pausing here and asking:

Machine Translated by Google

What kind of justice would we need if the problem were only behavior?
Correction would suffice.

What kind of justice would we need if the problem were simply ignorance?
Teaching would suffice.

But if the problem is that human beings are exposed to the truth without being able to respond to it, then
what is needed is a justice that does not depend on human beings.
absolute.
That is exactly what Pablo presents.

A justice system independent of the law
but confirmed by her
Paul adds something that avoids an immediate misunderstanding: this righteousness does not come from the
law, but neither does it contradict it.
The law does not produce it, but it points it out.

It does not generate it, but it bears witness to it.
This is important because it clarifies the role of the law without invalidating it. The law did not fail in its function.
It simply was never intended to justify.
How many times have we demanded that the law do something it was never designed to do?

When that happens, the law stops illuminating and begins to condemn.
Pablo restores his place: the law sets the stage, but does not provide the solution.

The direction of the action is decisive.
Here Paul introduces one of the most important turns in all of Romans: the direction of the action.

God does not respond to human justice.
Human justice responds to the action of God.

Machine Translated by Google

God presents.
God justifies.
God demonstrates His justice.
Human beings receive.
This order is non-negotiable.
Reversing it destroys the gospel.
What happens when this order is reversed, even subtly?
Faith becomes merit.
Grace becomes assistance.
Security becomes surveillance.
Paul does not allow any of those interpretations.

Justification: a verdict, not a trial
When Paul speaks of justification, he does so with precise language. He does not describe a gradual
process, a progressive improvement, or an internal transformation in the first place.
Describe a verdict.
To justify is to declare fair.
A verdict is not formed gradually.

It doesn't keep up with the times.
It does not depend on the emotional state of the accused.

It is pronounced.
And when the right judge pronounces it, reality changes, even if experience takes time to align.

This raises an inevitable question:
What would happen if we took God's verdict as seriously as we take our inner feelings?

Much of Christian instability stems from this: we believe that God declares something, but we live as if
the verdict were subject to review.
Romans does not allow that idea.

Machine Translated by Google

God's justice does not ignore the problem
solves it
Paul anticipates another silent objection:
if God justifies, isn't he overlooking sin?
His answer is clear: no.
God does not minimize the problem.
He doesn't relativize it.
He doesn't file it away without dealing with it.

God confronts him decisively.

That is why Paul speaks of demonstration. God's justice is not merely affirmed; it is publicly
displayed. God acts in such a way that His justice remains intact, His truth is uncompromised,
and His verdict is not arbitrary.
This matters because it ensures something fundamental:

Justification is not a lenient favor. It is a just action.
And if it is just, it cannot be revoked without God contradicting His own character.

Grace removes all boasting
Once the action is clearly from God, something immediately disappears: boasting.
Not partially.
Not gradually.
Full.
There is no room for shared credit.
There is no room for personal contribution.
There is no room for spiritual superiority.
Paul does not say that boasting should decrease.
She says she is excluded.
Because?
Because there is nothing to claim.

Machine Translated by Google

This is not humiliating.

It's liberating.

Boasting is tiring because it requires maintaining an image.
Grace is restful because it eliminates the need to do so.

Faith as a means, not as a merit
Paul now clarifies the role of faith, precisely to avoid another common misunderstanding.
Faith is not presented as a superior virtue that God rewards.
It is not a more refined work.
It is not an act that completes what God began.
Faith is the means by which one receives what God has done.
Look outwards, not inwards.
She rests in another, not in herself.
It's worth taking an honest pause here:
How many times have we turned faith into a new form of performance?
Measuring it, evaluating it, comparing it, asking ourselves if it was enough.
Pablo cuts that possibility off at the root.
Faith does not support the verdict.

The verdict sustains the faith.

A just and justifying God
Paul concludes this movement with a statement that supports the entire edifice: God is just and justifier.

He does not choose between justice and grace.

He doesn't sacrifice one for the other.

It does not balance internal tensions.
Act in a way that is consistent with who He is.
This means that the believer's security does not rest on a divine exception, but on God's faithfulness to
His own character.

Machine Translated by Google

If God has declared him righteous, on what basis could He un-declare him righteous?
About a human fluctuation?
About a subsequent fall?
About a changing experience?
Romans leaves no room for that idea.

The terrain has changed

With this move, something definitive has happened.
The question is no longer whether human beings can justify themselves.

That was resolved.
The question now is:
what does it mean to live under a verdict that has already been pronounced?
Before talking about life, Pablo will do something
else: make sure the verdict stands.
That will be the next move.

Machine Translated by Google

MOVEMENT 5
The verdict stands
(Romans 4:1–5:11)
After declaring that God justifies, Paul anticipates an inevitable concern. He doesn't frame it as a hostile
objection, but as an honest question that arises when something so...
The final word has been spoken.

If God has pronounced a verdict,
What is that verdict based on?
Can it stay?
Or does it depend, in some way, on what happens next?

Pablo does not leave these questions open.
She answers them patiently, because she knows that security does not come from an isolated statement,
but from understanding its foundation.

The verdict does not rest on human performance
Paul goes back in history, not to change the argument, but to show that God has always acted this way.

It introduces Abraham not as an example of spiritual effort, but as a case of reception. Abraham is not
presented as someone who achieved something, but as someone to whom something was credited.

This is deliberate.
Because if the verdict depended on performance, then Abraham—with his uneven history, questionable
decisions, and moments of hesitation—would be a poor candidate.

And yet, that is precisely where Paul wants us to look.
What kind of justice could be upheld over a life as unstable as that?
human?

Machine Translated by Google

The answer is clear: only a justice that is not based on human life, but on God's promise.

Accrediting is not transforming
is to declare.
Pablo uses accounting language: credit, impute, count.
This isn't poetic. It's precise.
Accrediting does not mean "making it fair through process".

It means “to consider fair by declaration”.
Justice is not described here as something that Abraham produced, but as something that God decided to
count as true concerning him.
And here a crucial distinction emerges:
God does not wait for the inner reality to be perfect to pronounce His
verdict.
Deliver the verdict to establish reality.
If this is reversed, faith becomes impossible.
Because no one could wait to be "ready" to receive justice.

Faith looks to the promise, not to progress
Paul insists on something that is often overlooked: Abraham's faith was not admirable because it was strong,
but because it had the right object.
Faith is not evaluated by its intensity, but by what it rests on.
Abraham did not rely on his own ability, his perseverance, or his future performance. He trusted in God's word,
even when his own experience seemed to contradict it.
It is worth pausing here:
How many times have we measured our faith by looking at ourselves, instead of looking at the
promise?

When faith becomes introspective, it weakens.
When she becomes objective, she rests.
Paul does not want the reader to admire Abraham's faith.
He wants me to understand how faith works.

The verdict precedes peace
With this clear, Paul moves on to one of the best-known—and most frequently misunderstood—
statements in Romans:
“Having been justified… we have peace.”
Order matters.
Peace is not the means to justification.
That's the result.
And it is not presented first as an emotion, but as a condition.
Peace does not begin within the human being.
It begins with the objective relationship between God and man.
This explains something that many believers experience but cannot name:
Why can there be anxiety even when peace with God is real?
Because peace does not depend on being felt in order to exist.
The relationship has been resolved, even though experience takes time to align.

Peace is not the absence of struggle
It is the absence of hostility.

Paul does not promise a life without conflict.
It promises a relationship without condemnation.

The peace he describes does not mean there are no internal tensions, doubts, questions, or
processes. It means the fundamental conflict has ended.

Machine Translated by Google

God is not against it.
God is not evaluating.

God is not waiting for something to go wrong.
This radically changes the tone of Christian life.
Because when peace is understood as fragile, life is lived with caution.
But when it is understood as declared, life can be breathed.

The main argument: if God acted when we were incapable…
Pablo reinforces this certainty with a simple but compelling logic.
If God acted when humanity was at its weakest, if He took the initiative when
there was no merit, if He resolved the situation when
there was no possible answer…
On what basis could he now undo what he has already established?
This reasoning is not emotional. It is logical.
God's action was not caused by human improvement.
Therefore, it cannot be overridden by human weakness.
Here Paul introduces an idea that runs throughout the rest of Romans:
Security does not rest on the constancy of the believer, but on the consistency of God.

Reconciliation: the relationship has changed
Paul now uses another key term: reconciliation.
Not to describe a feeling, but a situation.
Reconciliation is not the process by which human beings slowly return to God. It is the act by which God resolves
the relationship.
And it does so while human beings still cannot offer anything in return.

This ensures something fundamental:

Machine Translated by Google

The relationship is not pending review.
It is not in a trial period.
It is not subject to renegotiation.

The verdict does not weaken with time
With this move, Pablo has closed another important door: the idea that time, the process, or
experience could erode the verdict.
The verdict does not age.
It doesn't fit.
It does not become provisional.

If it depended on time, it would never be safe.
If it depended on performance, it would never be stable.
But it depends on God.
And that changes everything.

Preparing for the next turn
Up to this point, Paul has firmly established something:
God has acted.
God has declared.
The verdict stands.
Now a new question arises, perhaps the most unsettling for many:
If the verdict is final, what place does sin occupy now? Does it still
matter? How does
it relate to this certainty?
Pablo doesn't avoid that question.

That will be the next move.

MOVEMENT 6
Sin repositioned
(Romans 5:12–6:23)
After stating that the verdict stands, Paul knows that a question has already formed in the reader's
mind. It is not a rebellious question. It is a logical one.
If God has declared righteous,
if the relationship has been reconciled,
if peace has been established…
What place does sin occupy now?
Pablo doesn't avoid this question. He anticipates it. And the way he answers it is crucial to
understanding everything that follows.

Sin does not disappear
but stop defining.
Paul does not begin by minimizing sin. On the contrary, he broadens the perspective so that the reader
can see it more clearly.
Introduce Adam.
Not as an isolated moral figure, but as a representative head. Through him, sin enters the scene not
only as an act, but as a dominant condition. Sin is not presented first as something that is done, but as
something under which one lives.
This is important.
Because if sin were merely a series of bad decisions, a series of good decisions would be enough to
resolve it. But Paul describes something deeper: a reality that governs, that reigns, that exercises
dominion.
This raises a key question:
Why do we continue to treat sin primarily as behavior, when Paul presents it as power?

Machine Translated by Google

As long as sin is seen only as behavior, the solution will always be effort.
But Paul is preparing the reader to understand why the effort was never enough.

The decisive contrast: Adam and Christ
Paul does not present Christ as an improvement on Adam. He presents him as a new point of reference.

Just as humanity was defined by a reality it did not consciously choose, it is now defined by another reality
that it also does not produce on its own. In both cases, the central issue is not individual action, but
representative identification.
This challenges our usual way of thinking, because we prefer to believe that we are defined primarily by
what we do. Paul insists that we are defined first by the reality in which we live.

What changes if the central problem is not "what I do", but "where I live from"?

This change of framework alters everything.

Grace does not respond to a single fault.
responds to a complete condition.
Paul emphasizes something that should not be overlooked: grace is not a proportional reaction to sin. It
is not a fine-tuning. It is not minimal compensation.
It is a decisive intervention.
Where sin once reigned, grace now reigns.
It doesn't compete. It doesn't balance. It governs.

This does not mean that sin is unreal. It means that it is no longer sovereign.
It is worth pausing here:
What if we took seriously the idea that sin no longer has the final say over our standing before God?

On what, then, would our persistent guilt be based?
Where would our inner condemnation derive its authority?

Machine Translated by Google

The inevitable objection
At this point, Paul introduces the objection that many still raise today, although not always aloud:

If grace reigns, does it
matter how we live? Doesn't
that open the door to indifference?
The way Pablo responds is crucial.
It doesn't say: "It does matter, so be careful."
He does not retreat from grace.
It does not impose conditions.
He says something more radical:

That question doesn't understand the change that has occurred.

Death and life: categories, not metaphors
Pablo responds by redefining the terms.
He speaks of death and life not as sensations, but as objective realities. Dying to sin does not mean ceasing
to experience temptation. It means ceasing to live under its control .
domain.
This is where many readers get confused, because they look for an immediate experience that confirms the
statement. But Paul isn't describing first what it feels like, but rather what
what is it.

What happens when we demand to feel a truth before accepting it as real?
The truth remains suspended.
Experience becomes the judge.
And rest never comes.
Pablo reverses that order.

Identity precedes behavior

Machine Translated by Google

One of the most important movements in this passage is the order that Paul carefully maintains.

It does not say: “leave sin to become something new.”
He says: “They are something new; that is why sin no longer rules.”
The exhortation comes after the declaration.
Behavior flows from identity.
Never the other way around.

Herein lies one of the great distortions of the Christian life:
Trying to produce with effort what can only flow from an already established reality.

That causes exhaustion.
It produces chronic guilt.
It produces cycles of promise and failure.
Pablo does not call for a struggle to obtain an identity.
It calls for living in accordance with a given identity.

Obedience changes in nature

When sin ceases to be the master, obedience ceases to be survival.
It is no longer an attempt to avoid condemnation.

It is no longer an effort to ensure acceptance.
It is no longer a bargaining chip.
It becomes the answer.
Paul introduces a powerful image here: slavery. But not to instill fear, but to clarify an unavoidable reality: we
always serve something.
The question is not whether we serve, but whom.
And here's the twist:
Serving justice does not mean losing freedom.
It is living in alignment with the reality that already defines us.

Machine Translated by Google

The fruit reveals the new dominion
Paul doesn't use fear to motivate. He uses results.
Ask the reader to observe honestly:
What did sin produce when he ruled?
Shame.
Death.
Fragmentation.
And then it shows the contrast:
When grace reigns, the fruit changes. Not because of external pressure, but because of its dominion.
has changed.

This is a point that many believers need to listen to calmly:
The fruit does not prove acceptance.
The source reveals.

Sin loses authority
when he loses his place.
With this move, Paul is not teaching “how to overcome sin.” He is doing something more fundamental:
he is dethroning it.
Sin no longer defines the relationship.
It no longer interprets identity.
It no longer determines the verdict.

He remains serious.
It is still harmful.
But he is no longer sovereign.

And this is where the book's title resonates powerfully:
It's resolved!
Not because the believer has resolved their struggle, but
because God has already resolved the relationship.

Machine Translated by Google

Preparing for the next move
Now another question arises, just as important as the previous one:
If sin no longer reigns,
if the identity has changed,
If grace reigns…
What role does the law play now?
Many believers instinctively return to the law to manage their lives. Paul doesn't ignore this. He addresses it
directly.
That will be the next move.

Purpose of this book
This book was written to help the reader understand a simple, but often misunderstood truth:

What God has resolved does not need to be resolved again by us.
Many believers live as if their standing before God is fragile, uncertain, or dependent on their
ongoing performance. The message of Romans presents a very different picture: one in which God acts
decisively, justly, and ultimately.
This book does not attempt to be technical or academic.

It is written in clear and reflective language, so that the reader can follow Paul's argument without needing
prior theological training.
Romans will be treated as a message to be understood, not just as verses to be quoted.

MOVEMENT 8
Life from a resolved verdict
(Romans 8)
Having repositioned sin and clarified the place of the law, Paul arrives at the point where all the preceding
work should lead. He does not introduce a new idea. He declares the

inevitable consequence of everything that has already been established.
And it does so with a statement that admits no gradations or exceptions:
Now, therefore, there is no condemnation.
It is not a future promise.
It is not a spiritual goal.
It's not an experience reserved for the elderly.
It is a present reality that flows directly from a verdict already pronounced.

“No condemnation” is not a feeling
It's a position.
Paul doesn't say that the believer doesn't feel condemned. He says that he isn't.
This distinction is fundamental.
Because many believers evaluate their relationship with God based on their inner state.
When they feel strong, they assume everything is fine. When they feel weak, they assume
something has changed.
But Paul doesn't appeal to feelings. He appeals to the court.

What authority does a feeling have over a verdict?
None.
The sentence is not reduced gradually.
It is not temporarily suspended.
It does not reactivate due to subsequent failures.

It simply does not exist for those who are in Christ.

Machine Translated by Google

Life is not assisted
is originated.
Paul now introduces the Spirit not as an external help, but as the very source of life.

This is key.
The Spirit does not come to strengthen the flesh.

It is not intended to improve human performance.
It does not serve to complement the weakness.
It gives rise to a different kind of life.
That is why Paul does not describe the believer as someone who struggles with divine help, but as someone
who lives from a new reality. The Christian life is not the old life sustained by spiritual resources; it is life from a
different source.
It is worth pausing here:
How many times have we lived as if the Spirit were an assistant and not the origin?

That explains why exhaustion persists even amidst much spiritual activity.

Meat loses authority
not because it disappears, but because it ceases to govern.
Paul does not deny the presence of the flesh. He does not promise its immediate eradication. But he
does affirm something decisive: it no longer rules.
Governing is not the same as being present.
The meat can persist.
You can scream.

He can accuse.
But it no longer has jurisdiction.
This completely changes the dynamics of the Christian life.

Machine Translated by Google

The struggle is no longer about acceptance.
Obedience ceases to be survival.
Holiness ceases to be a bargaining chip.
Everything flows from a resolved relationship.

Adoption replaces insecurity
Paul now introduces a language that transforms the way the believer perceives himself: adoption.

Not as a sentimental metaphor, but as a legal status.
Adoption does not describe a warm feeling toward God. It describes an objective relationship where belonging
has been established. The believer does not approach God as someone being evaluated, but as a
child.
And here something profound happens:

Fear loses its foundation.
Not because life becomes easy, but because the relationship is no longer at risk.

How does obedience change when it is no longer motivated by fear of losing the relationship?

It changes its nature completely.

Suffering no longer defines the relationship
Paul does not ignore suffering. He does not spiritualize it or minimize it. But he does reframe it.
Suffering is no longer evidence of rejection.

It is not a sign of regression.
It is not an indication of a pending conviction.
It is part of a creation that still awaits its complete release.
Here Paul broadens the perspective: the Christian life does not unfold in a world that is already resolved, but in
one that is moving towards its final resolution.

Machine Translated by Google

And the believer does not suffer as someone unsure of the outcome, but as someone who knows
the end.

The Spirit sustains where language fails.
Paul acknowledges something profoundly human: there are times when we don't even know how to pray.

This is not spiritual weakness. It is honesty.
And here he introduces one of the most comforting statements in the chapter: when language fails, the
Spirit does not fail.
The believer is sustained not by the quality of his prayers, but by the faithfulness of God.
who knows the depths of the heart.
This reinforces everything stated above:

The Christian life does not rest on the human capacity to sustain God, but on the constant action of
God sustaining the believer.

Nothing can reopen the case.
Paul concludes the chapter—and this entire section of Romans—with a series of questions that do
not seek answers, because they already contain them.
If God is for us,
Who can stand against us?
Not as a rhetorical challenge, but as a logical conclusion.
Paul goes through all imaginable possibilities: accusation, separation, failure, opposition, suffering, death.

And he discards them one by one.

Not because they don't exist, but because none of them has sufficient authority to reverse what God
has declared.
Here the book's message becomes unmistakable:
There is no circumstance that can invalidate a verdict pronounced by God.

Machine Translated by Google

The Christian life as active rest
Romans 8 does not call for passivity. It calls for rest.
But not to an inert rest, but to a rest from which life can flow without fear.
Obedience no longer seeks to ensure acceptance.
Holiness no longer tries to avoid rejection.
Life is no longer lived under threat.
One lives from an established reality.

The argument has come to an end
With this move, Pablo has completed the journey:
God as a reference point

Human collapse
No advantage
The decisive action of God
The verdict that remains
Sin repositioned
The law clarified
Life flows from a closed case
Nothing remains pending.
Nothing is left unresolved.
Therefore, the reader can only reach one honest conclusion:
It's resolved!
Not from our perspective, not
from our consistency, not from
our experience,
but from God's perspective.

Machine Translated by Google

And when that is understood, the Christian life can finally be lived as it was designed:
not as a struggle to remain accepted,
but as a life sustained by an already established truth.

EPILOGUE

History as proof
After arriving at such an absolute statement as "no condemnation" and "nothing can separate us," an honest
question may arise in the attentive reader.
Not a disbelieving question, but a prudent one:
How do we know that this security is not just a well-constructed idea?
How do we know it's not spiritual rhetoric?
How do we know that God truly stands by what He declares, even when the story gets complicated?

Pablo answers that question in an unexpected way.
Not with a new promise.
Not with a final exhortation.
But with history.

God is not faithful only in theory.
If Romans 8 stood alone, it might seem like a lofty, almost idealistic statement. But Paul doesn't leave that
certainty hanging in the air. Immediately afterward, he turns his attention to the people who know both
promise and failure best: Israel.
And it does so for a clear reason.
If God were a God who abandons His word when the human response is inconsistent, Israel
would be the ultimate proof.
If God adjusted His commitments according to performance, Israel would be the clearest example of
rupture.
And yet, Pablo insists on the opposite.

Machine Translated by Google

History does not contradict God

He confirms it.
The history of Israel is not the story of a flawless people. It is the story of promises kept through infidelity,
exile, silence, and prolonged waiting.
Paul does not present it to justify man.
She presents it to defend God.
Because if God had failed in His purpose for Israel, then Romans 8 would be weak.
But if God has preserved His word throughout centuries of historical complexity, then the believer's security does
not rest on momentary emotions, but on character .
proven.
It is worth pausing here:
What kind of God would we need to entrust with something as definitive as our salvation?

One who does not back down.

One who doesn't improvise.

One who does not abandon what he has promised.
That is exactly the God that history reveals.

God's faithfulness does not depend on the human response
Paul observes the history of Israel and comes to a clear conclusion: God's faithfulness is not measured by the
consistency of the people, but by the constancy of God himself.
God fulfills His promises not because human beings uphold them, but because He has committed Himself
to them.
This reinforces everything said in Romans 1–8.

If God has been faithful in the historical context,
Why wouldn't it be on a personal level?
If He has not reversed His purposes throughout generations,
Why would he do it now with those he has justified?

Christian security is not naive

Machine Translated by Google

It is historic.
Christian faith does not rest on a fragile hope or an optimistic interpretation of life. It rests on a God whose
faithfulness can be tested over time.
Israel is not a side note.
It is the visible testimony that God does not abandon what He has declared.
Therefore, Romans 8 is not the emotional climax of the letter, but its logical conclusion.
And Romans 9–11 does not contradict it; it supports it.

The verdict stands because God stands.
The reader can conclude this journey with a deeper certainty than at the beginning.
Not because he now knows himself better, but because
he now knows God better.
A God who:
It begins what it promises,
He stands by what he says,
and fulfills what it has determined.
That is why the Christian life can be lived without fear of revocation.
Not because the believer is constant, but
because God is.

The last word
The story does not reopen the case.

He confirms it.
And so, at the end of Romans 1–8 —backed by the history of Israel— the reader does not need to add
anything, clarify anything, or assure anything.
He can only state, with complete confidence:
It's resolved!
