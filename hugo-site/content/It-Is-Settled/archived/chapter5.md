## Chapter 5 – Standing (Refined Direction)

### Sin Repositioned

Once standing is established, a question naturally follows.

If the situation between God and a person has truly been resolved,
 what place does sin now have?

If condemnation is no longer the basis of the relationship,
 does sin still matter?
 And if it does, how can it be addressed without undoing what has already been settled?

This is not a careless question.
 It is an honest one.
 And Scripture does not avoid it — it answers it.

Sin is not ignored.
 But it is no longer allowed to sit where it once sat.

### Sin Is No Longer the Defining Issue

Before God acted, sin defined everything.
 It exposed the problem.
 It separated.
 It brought judgment into view.

But once God acts decisively, sin no longer occupies that same position.

It does not disappear.
 But it is displaced.

And that distinction matters.

Sin is still real.
 It still causes damage.
 It still needs to be addressed in daily life.
 But it no longer defines standing before God.

It no longer governs access.
 It no longer determines belonging.

Standing is now defined by what Christ accomplished,
 not by what a person fails to maintain.

If sin were still allowed to define the relationship,
 then nothing would truly be settled.
 Everything would return to uncertainty.
 Life would become constant maintenance again.

That is exactly what this message refuses to allow.

Once the question about sin is addressed, another question naturally follows:
 If Christ’s sufficiency now counts for me, what actually changed?

The answer is not only that something was forgiven.
 Something was established.

Standing speaks of position. It describes where a person now stands before God. This is not a feeling or a mindset. It is not optimism or motivation. It is a fact.

Through Christ, a new standing was brought into existence. It was not formed gradually or offered conditionally. It was established decisively. This standing does not depend on personal awareness. It does not depend on the strength of belief. It does not rise and fall with performance. It exists because God made it so.

Christ’s sufficiency did not merely offer assistance. It supplied what was required. What could not be produced personally was provided completely. For this reason, the standing before God is not partial, provisional, or awaiting completion. It is complete because the work that established it is complete.

Union with Christ describes this reality. A person is no longer standing on a personal record but in His. What is true of Him in relation to God now defines the relationship with God. This is why the language of sonship appears—not as a reward earned, but as a placement granted.

Standing is not something held together by effort. It is something established by God. It does not shift with mood, weaken with struggle, or disappear with failure. It remains because its source is not human resolve but divine action.

This is the reality: Christ’s sufficiency has supplied a perfect standing before God.

This standing is not temporary. It is not a trial period. It is not something that improves over time or weakens with difficulty. It was not formed by human effort, and it is not sustained by human effort. It stands because God established it.

What God establishes does not fluctuate with circumstances. It does not adjust to mood, and it does not retreat when challenges appear. The basis of this standing is not personal strength or consistency. Its basis is Christ and the work He completed.

For this reason, standing is not fragile. It does not need to be protected, defended, or constantly repaired. It is not something that must be rebuilt after every failure. It is a position that exists because its foundation exists.

A person may not fully understand this standing. A person may not even be aware of its depth. But lack of awareness does not erase reality. The standing does not come into existence when it is discovered, and it does not disappear when it is overlooked. It remains what it is because its origin is not human knowledge but divine action.

This is why the language of access becomes clear. The door is not being opened repeatedly. It has been opened. The relationship is not waiting to begin. It has been established. The position is not being negotiated. It has been granted.

Standing, then, is not movement. It is placement.
 It is not effort. It is fact.
 It is not becoming. It is being.

This is what Christ’s sufficiency secured — a real, present, and unchanging standing before God.

Because this standing was established by God, it does not depend on personal stability. It does not improve when a person feels strong, and it does not weaken when a person feels weak. It is not measured by emotional certainty or by the ability to explain it. It stands on what Christ accomplished, not on how well it is understood.

This means standing is not something a person moves in and out of. It is not entered on good days and lost on difficult ones. It is not maintained by discipline, nor is it undone by inconsistency. It exists because its foundation exists.

The change that occurred was not cosmetic. It was not an adjustment in attitude. It was a change in position before God. The relationship is no longer defined by distance or uncertainty. It is defined by what Christ secured.

Nothing about this standing is imaginary. It is not positive thinking or spiritual optimism. It is the result of an action taken by God and completed in Christ. Whether it is fully understood or only partially grasped, the reality does not shift.

This is why the language of access is direct. The way is not being reopened again and again. It has been opened. The relationship is not waiting to begin. It has been established. The position is not being negotiated. It has been granted.

Standing, then, is not progress.
 It is placement.
 It is not striving.
 It is reality.

Because this standing is real, life is no longer lived from uncertainty. The relationship with God is not being negotiated day by day. It is already established. This changes how a person faces ordinary life.

Difficulties do not disappear, but they no longer carry the same message. Hardship is no longer read as rejection, and struggle is no longer interpreted as distance. Circumstances may still be challenging, but they do not undo position. The ground does not shift every time life becomes unstable.

This does not remove responsibility or erase consequences in daily choices. What it removes is the constant fear that every failure resets the relationship. Standing remains while life is being lived. The foundation does not rise and fall with performance.

From this position, reliance begins to make sense. Reliance is not an attempt to keep the standing intact. The standing is already intact. Reliance is simply the natural response to what is already true.

In the same way a person leans on a structure that is known to be solid, trust in Christ grows from recognizing that the foundation is secure. It is not pressure to believe harder. It is the quiet continuation of depending on what has already proven sufficient.

Life is no longer driven by the need to secure belonging.
 Belonging is already secure.
 Reliance flows from reality, not fear.

Standing came from Christ’s work.
 Continued trust is simply living in the light of that work.

Standing, then, is not something being chased or preserved. It is something that has been established. Christ’s sufficiency did not place a person on unstable ground; it set a firm position before God. From that position, life is faced differently, not because circumstances vanish, but because the relationship no longer shifts with them. Trust does not hold this standing together; it simply rests in what already stands. The reality remains what God made it — secure, present, and unchanged.
