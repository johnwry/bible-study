## Chapter 7 — The Law for Living

Another question appears at this point.

If standing is real,
 and struggle still happens,
 why does doing the right thing sometimes feel so difficult?

The issue is not usually lack of knowledge.
 Most people know what they should do.
 The issue is the inability to carry it through.

This is where many turn to motivation.

“Don’t give up.”
 “Try harder.”
 “Do your best.”
 “Push yourself.”

When that motivation fades, a common source of fuel is guilt.
 And the place guilt is most easily found is the law.

The law is clear.
 It draws lines.
 It exposes what is wrong.
 It makes a person aware of failure.

And that awareness often turns into pressure.
 Guilt becomes the fuel used to try to do better.

But guilt is a weak fuel.
 It produces effort for a moment,
 then frustration,
 then exhaustion.

The law was never given to be an engine for daily living.
 It reveals what is right,
 but it does not supply the strength to live it.

Using the law as motivation often creates a cycle.
 A person becomes aware of what is wrong, feels guilty, tries harder, fails, and then feels guilty again.

Sometimes the cycle looks different.
 Awareness leads to guilt, guilt leads to effort, effort leads to temporary success — and success turns into pride.

Neither path produces the life God intended.
 In both cases the standard becomes clearer,
 but the power to live up to it does not increase.

This is not because the law is bad.
 It is because the law was never meant to be the source of life.

Something else happened when standing was established.

A person was not only given a new position before God.
 They were also moved under a new authority.

Not law as motivator,
 but grace.

Grace does not use guilt as fuel.
 It works differently.
 It provides a stronger reason to live rightly
 and the ability to do so.

This is not effort-based performance.
 It is reliance on Christ’s sufficiency.
 It is life fueled by faith rather than pressure.

Every time a person tries to push life forward by guilt,
 they often end up condemning themselves and returning to the same old patterns they were trying to escape.

The struggle increases, not because nothing changed,
 but because the wrong source of motivation is being used.

The standing is real.
 The provision is real.
 But guilt does not fit the realm Christ brought you into.
 Life in Him was never designed to run on condemnation.
 It was designed to run on grace.

Grace is not passive.
 It is an effective trainer and motivator.
 Where the law demanded what was right but could not produce it, grace supplies both the reason and the strength to live it.
 The problem was never knowing the standard.
 The problem was lacking the power to meet it.

The struggle, then, is not proof that nothing changed. It is often proof that the wrong source of motivation is still being used. The law can show what is right, but it cannot supply the strength to live it. When guilt becomes the fuel, life turns into cycles of defeat or pride, and neither produces the life God intended. What changed through Christ was not only standing but authority. Life was never meant to run on pressure and self-condemnation. It was meant to flow from grace — not as permission to drift, but as the only source strong enough to produce what the law could only describe.
