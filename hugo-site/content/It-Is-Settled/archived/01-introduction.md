# Introduction  
## Why “It Is Settled”

Few phrases create more tension in the Christian life than the question:

*“Am I secure before God?”*

For many, assurance feels temporary. It rises and falls with obedience, emotions, spiritual disciplines, or recent failures. Even sincere believers often live with an unspoken fear that something could still go wrong.

The letter to the Romans confronts that fear directly.

Paul does not build his case on human faithfulness, but on **God’s action**, **God’s righteousness**, and **God’s integrity** (Romans 1:16–17). From the opening chapters, Romans presses the reader toward a single conclusion:

What God has declared righteous, He does not later place back into question.

## A Common Struggle

Many Christians hold two beliefs at the same time:

1. God justifies the sinner freely (Romans 3:24).
2. The believer must now maintain that standing through effort.

Romans does not allow these two ideas to coexist comfortably.

If righteousness is credited apart from works, then it is not sustained by works either (Romans 4:4–5). If peace with God is established by God’s action, then it cannot be undone by human weakness (Romans 5:1).

This tension is not theoretical — it affects how people pray, serve, obey, and even how they read Scripture.

## Why Romans Matters

Romans is not written to tell believers how to *become* spiritual.  
It is written to explain **what God has already done**.

Paul’s argument unfolds carefully:

- The universal problem of sin (Romans 1:18–3:20)
- The inability of law to resolve it (Romans 3:19–20)
- God’s decisive action in Christ (Romans 3:21–26)
- The certainty of justification (Romans 4:1–8)
- The implications of that certainty for life (Romans 5–8)

This book follows that same flow, allowing Romans to speak on its own terms.

## What This Book Is — and Is Not

This book **is**:
- An explanation of Romans in simple language
- Focused on clarity and flow
- Rooted in the text itself

This book **is not**:
- A theological debate
- A system of doctrines
- A manual for Christian performance

The aim is understanding — because **clarity produces rest**, and rest produces fruit (Romans 6:22).

In the next chapter, we begin where Paul begins:  
not with solutions, but with the problem that makes the solution necessary (Romans 1:18).
