# Chapter 3  
## God’s Solution, Not Ours

Romans does not present God as responding to human effort.  
It presents God as acting in response to human inability.

This distinction is critical.

If the solution depends on human action, then assurance will always remain fragile.  
If the solution depends on God’s action, then assurance can finally rest.

Romans insists on the second (Romans 3:21).

## A Righteousness Revealed

At the center of Romans is a decisive shift.

After establishing the universal problem, Paul introduces something entirely new:

Not a new command,  
not a refined law,  
not a higher standard —

but **a righteousness revealed** (Romans 3:21–22).

This righteousness does not originate with humanity.  
It does not emerge from obedience, sincerity, or moral progress.

It comes from God.

---

## The Direction of the Action

One of the most important observations in Romans is the *direction* of the action.

God is not reacting to human righteousness.  
Human righteousness is responding to God’s action.

Paul is explicit:
- God sets forth Christ (Romans 3:25)
- God justifies the one who believes (Romans 3:26)
- Humanity receives the outcome by faith (Romans 3:22)

When this order is reversed, the message collapses.

## Justification Is a Verdict

Romans does not describe justification as a process.  
It describes it as a **verdict**.

Paul uses courtroom language intentionally:  
to justify is to declare righteous (Romans 3:24; Romans 4:5).

A verdict does not evolve.  
It is declared.

And once declared by the proper authority, it stands.

---

## Grace Removes Boasting

If justification comes from God’s action alone, something must disappear.

Boasting.

Paul states this directly: boasting is excluded (Romans 3:27).

There is nothing left to claim:
- no contribution
- no leverage
- no personal addition

Grace does not leave room for partial credit.

This is not humiliating — it is liberating.

---

## Faith as the Means, Not the Merit

Faith plays a central role in Romans, but not the role many assume.

Faith is not presented as a virtue that earns God’s response.  
It is presented as the **means of receiving** what God has done.

Paul contrasts faith with works explicitly (Romans 4:4–5).

Faith looks outward, not inward.  
It rests in God’s action, not human strength.

---

## Why This Changes Everything

Once God’s solution is seen clearly, the weight lifts.

- Fear loses its grip
- Performance loses its pressure
- Assurance gains its footing

The believer is no longer trying to secure a future verdict.  
They are learning to live from one already given (Romans 5:1).

Romans does not invite the reader to try harder.  
It invites the reader to **believe what God has already declared**.

---

In the next chapter, Paul addresses the question that inevitably follows:

If justification is truly God’s verdict —  
can it ever be undone?
